                  hand lady behind the scenes who is making sure that the
                  backend of your business is running smoothly and efficiently.

                  really concentrate on your business again. New products,
                  growth and expansion, more work life balance ....the

                  VA which stands for Virtual Assistant is a person you hire on
                  to take on tasks. Every business has tasks both small and
                  large that take up hours of their days, weeks or months. It’s
                  these tasks that do not allow a CEO to really run their
                  business effectively. When you have too many tasks on your
                  plate that you are trying to accomplish at once, are you
                  really able to give 100% to each of them in your work week
                  while taking on new challenges that will inevitably come up?
                  Simple answer…..no! Hiring someone to take on one or more of
                  these tasks will give you your TIME back! The most precious
                  resource a business owner can have.

                What is the difference between an OBM and a VA?

                  To put is simply, VA’s are tasks oriented and an OBM is big
                  picture management oriented. VA’s take on a specific task or
                  tasks given to them. This can be one and done tasks like
                  research or graphics or ongoing tasks like social media
                  management or customer service. OBM’s are ongoing business
                  managers that look at the big picture of your business while
                  running your day to day operations. We are consistently
                  improving your processes so your business is always running
                  smoothly while constantly improving. We can even manage your
                  VA!

                  This is a great questions but depends on your needs as a
                  business owner as well as how established your business is. If
                  you are just getting started and have a smaller budget, a VA
                  might be what you need. Your business may but not large enough
                  to really need full on operational assistance but someone to
                  come in and take some tasks off you plate might be just what
                  you need in order for you to continue to GROW your business.
                  TIME is truly an amazing asset. You can also hire a
                  specialized VA’s for the tasks you may not know enough about
                  but are very important to your growth. Social Media
                  Strategists and Writers are an example. If you are more
                  established and your business is really taking off then an OBM
                  is exactly what you need. You are at a point in your business
                  where you can NOT do it all. This is a hard concept to come to
                  terms with for some business owners. As an owner you know what
                  you want from your business and where you want it to go, but
                  you can’t do it alone. Having someone help with the backend of
                  your business allows your business to run smoothly and
                  optimally so you are able to concentrate on the front end and
                  growth and your business. The better your operations are
                  running on the back end, the more smooth and easy transitions
                  become on the fore front making the next big step you have
                  planned for your business an easy one.
